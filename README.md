Workout timer to time your routine during an exercise.

Write an algorithm that starts a timer (that counts up in seconds, minutes and hours). This
timer can be started, paused/continued or stopped.
When the timer is paused and then continued, it should resume from where it has
stopped previously
When a timer is stopped, it should still display the time at which it was stopped
at until it is started again
